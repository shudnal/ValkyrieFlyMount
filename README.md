# Valkyrie Fly Mount
Use the Valkyrie as your fly mount. You can even fight from her.

## Features
* Allows you to summon Valkyrie and control her flight
* After drop you will be granted Slow Fall until you touched the ground
* While flying you still take 10% damage (be careful)
* You can use your weapons and use items like tombstones, chests, etc...
* You can not hit the ground and can not fly higher than 1000 (there is really nothing there)
* Mod is client-sided and can be used at vanilla dedicated servers (pls don't exploit it (￢_￢;) )
* You will be healed a bit when mounted
* The crosshair will be hidden until you use a bow or crossbow
* You won't take freeze damage while mounted
* I believe you aren't used to flight music
* You can summon several Valkyries if you are in multiplayer
* If by any mean you are stucked flying you can click Skip Intro in Menu to teleport to your bed (current spawn point)

## Mount control
To summon the Valkyrie you can use both set and default shortcuts:
 * configurable shortcut for keyboard (default: LeftShift + T)
 * AltPlace + Crouch + Jump (default: LeftShift + LeftControl + Space)
 * JoyAltPlace + JoyCrouch + JoyJump (depends on used layout)

To drop from the Valkyrie you can use both set and default shortcuts:
 * configurable shortcut for keyboard (default: LeftShift + E)
 * AltPlace + Use (default: LeftShift + E)
 * JoyAltPlace + JoyUse (depends on used layout)

You can not summon the Valkyrie if you are:
 * attached to ship
 * sitting
 * sleeping
 * dead
 * riding
 * teleporting
 * placing objects with hammer
 * inside the dungeon

You will not control the Valkyrie if you are:
 * chatting
 * looking at map
 * fiddling with inventory
 * free flying
 * staring at store

You can press Run button (LeftShift by default) to "run" while spending stamina. More time you "run" more speed you get.

If you don't touched the controls (nor mouse nore joystick movement nore keyboard clicks, nothing) for 2 min (120 sec) the Valkyrie will be flying you to Start Temple until you touch the controls again.

You will go through the objects while flying.

## Installation (manual)
extract ValkyrieFlyMount.dll file to your BepInEx\Plugins\ folder

## Known issues
* BetterArchery won't let you hide crosshair
